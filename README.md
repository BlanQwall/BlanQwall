### - 👋 Hi, I'm Qiang. 

I have to say this is quite a brutal start with a README markdown as I have nothing prepared but this page just comes into my face. Anyway, let's give a flying-in introduction of me. 

I'm not a "coder" for most Github users, but I look like a computing geek in the eyes of those conventional biologists. I have been trained as a "traditional" biologist with all my bachelor, master and PhD in biology. Even now, my main work as a scientist is still doing the "wet" experiments. Why "wet"? Because most of the biological experiments are made in solutions. For example, we need liquid media to culture cells and analyze them in liquid buffer and never dry them (of course they die when lacking water). But since my PhD training in 2009, I start analyzing complex biological data with "heavy" computing. The quotes means this sounds a little ridiculous today to say "heavy" for just launching a Significance Analysis of Microarrays with 1G RAM. But trust me, that was indeed "heavy" for most of biologists working only on "wet" benches, since we needed before that only Excel to calculate p-values for a low sample number (<20 in most cases). Today, we are working routinely with high-throuput sequencing data and single-cell sequencing data, even single-cell multiomics sequencing data, which requires much more competences of "real" informaticians. Most of time, a such experiment can give a big bite in lab's budget so needs a really carefull design before start.

### - 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things... 

Sometimes I think I'm just distracted too much by too many things in this wonderful world... But I don't think all the life hobbies are really what's expected to show here. Ok, the interests related to the informatics are below: 

+ 	linux bash: mainly for working with analysis pipeline, like file handling, scripts for automatically running long analyses, sometimes working with the read sequences in NGS analysis. 
+ 	R: that's the language on which I spend most time every day. Most of my post-sequencing analyses, including almost single-cell analyses, are carried on with the uncountable R packages. I use always Rstudio in my work, so I'm also intested in: 
+ 	markdown/rmarkdown: that's a very beautiful part of Rstudio. I learn continuously from this site: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/. 
+ 	Python: still learning that but I don't work much with it. I found quite a lot of interesting Python packages that I like to play for data-mining. Yes, in most of time, that's only for fun. 

Of course it's only the languages used in my working or daily life. In a higher level, my interest is to answer the sophisticated biological questions by deep analyzing the huge amount of data generated with the most-advanced technologies. This technologies include: 

+ 	Next-generation sequencing: to distinguish from the next point, I would say all the sequence analysis, e.g. genomic variants/SNP, gene structure, TCR/BCR structure, etc. 
+ 	Single-cell analysis: here we can generalize the concept to all the techiques that mesure the biological responses of individual cells, e.g. flow cytometry, high-resolution imaging, digital PCR, etc. Most of these data were analzed in a 2-dimension way that might hide a big amount of useful information behind these precious data. I'm trying to re-visit these data and give them new values. However, now a big part of my daily work is to deal with the huge amount of sequencing data from single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multi-omics sequencing (transcriptmic + epigenomic). I'm quite interested in all the high-resolution spatial sequencing technologies even though I have not yet really touched any data from it. 

### - 🌱 I’m currently learning Latex. 

I knew people several years ago writing their scientific paper and thesis with Latex. I thought we had to get really geek enough before writing papers using another language. Microsoft was my friend. 

But recently I tried some some well-made templates and rendered them neatly into reports. It was that time I told myself I should also be geek on this... 

### - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

That's really depend on wet bench work or dry screen work, on research fields. Contact me first.
