- 👋 Hi, I'm Qiang. 

I have to say this is quite a brutal start with a README markdown as I have nothing prepared but this page just comes into my face. Anyway, let's give a flying-in introduction of me. 

I'm not a "coder" for most of Github users, but I look like a computing geek in the eyes of those conventional biologists. I have been trained as a "traditional" biologist with all my bachelor, master and PhD in biology. Even now, my main work as a scientist is still doing the "wet" experiments. Why "wet"? Because most of the biological experiments are made in solutions. For example, we need liquid media to culture cells and analyze them in liquid buffer and never dry them (of course they die when lacking water). But since my PhD training in 2009, I start analyzing complex biological data with "heavy" computing. The quotes means this sounds a little ridiculous today to say "heavy" for just launching a Significance Analysis of Microarrays with 1G RAM. But trust me, that was indeed "heavy" for most of biologists working only on "wet" benches, since we needed before that only Excel to calculate p-values for a low sample number (<20 in most cases). Today, we are working routinely with high-throuput sequencing data and single-cell sequencing data, even single-cell multiomics sequencing data, which requires much more competences of "real" informaticians. Most of time, a such experiment can give a big bite in lab's budget so needs a really carefull design before start.
